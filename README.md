# Recipe-Scraper
A recipe scraper to help out the weekly meal planning

This was my first solo project in Python. Every week my wife and I struggle to come up with new meal ideas for the upcoming week. This program scrapes one of her favorite recipe websites and pulls 10 random recipes for us to choose from.

As I continue to work on this project I hope to implement the following:
  * Incorporate two additional websites to add a wider variety of recipes to sample from
  * Incorporate a scheduler and automated email system so that every Friday night the program will run and send the random selections to my wife and I via email
